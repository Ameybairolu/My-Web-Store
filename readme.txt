Please Note: 
1. I wasnt provided with the images to be included in the products page. So while searching for the images online, I got this 
link -> http://w4.host22.com/products.php and I downloaded the images from there. I couldn't find the images used in the other pages so I uploaded
the images I found appropriate. 

2. I changed the 'address' field to 'comments' in the form used in about_us.php as the purpose of that form is to obtain comments. 

3. The text used in the 'About Us' page and the 'Contact Us' page is same as the text mentioned in the PDF you provided for the project instructions.

4. I created an extra table 'contactus' (which wasnt mentioned in your lessons) whose purpose is to only obtain the details filled in the 'Contact Us' page.
